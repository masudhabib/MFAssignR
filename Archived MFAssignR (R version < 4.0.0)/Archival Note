This version of MFAssignR is the version described in the publication:

Schum S.K., L. E. Brown, L. R. Mazzoleni, MFAssignR: Molecular Formula Assignment Software for Ultrahigh 
Resolution Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Environmental Complex Mixtures, Revised and Re-Submitted, 
Environmental Research, 2020.

Further, this version does not work with R version >= 4.0.0, but does work with earlier versions.

This version is being archived so that interested parties can look at the version that directly relates to
the publication listed above, though newer versions are still well described by this publication as of
August 2020.

This version is still appropriate and functional if you are using a version of R < 4.0.0, but is missing
some functionality of newer versions, namely additional halogens and the ability to handle a three-column
data frame input.
