Package Updates

10/25/2018
- POEx option is now working
- NOEx (negative odd electron assignment) has now been implemented
- Fluorine assignment now implemented (Flx)

01/18/2019
- See documentation for more in depth description of the changes
- Addition of more versions of MFAssign functions (MFAssignAll_MSMS, MFAssign_RMD, MFAssignCHO_RMD)
- Added new noise estimation function "KMDNoise" and renamed original to "HistNoise"
- Included 34S and 2 13C as potential isotopic masses in IsoFiltR
- Improved mass recalibration by adding a segmented "walking" component
- Changed name of MFRecalcheck to "Recal"
- Changed name of MFRecalList to "RecalList"
- Added second mass recalibration function "Recal_2", which is slightly different than "Recal"
- Generally enhanced performance and speed of the functions in the package
- Improved molecular formula assignment by decreasing incorrect sulfur assignments

05/13/2019
- Made the sulfur isotope check optional via the "SulfCheck" parameter
- Removed MFAssignAll() and MFAssignAll_MSMS() 
- Added the functionality of those functions to MFAssign and MFAssignCHO() with the parameters "Ambig" and "MSMS" respectively
- Added RecalX() and Recal_2X() as additional recalibration functions. See documentation for more information
- General improvements to flexibility and transparency of moleular formula assignment.

10/10/2019
- Combined all four versions of Recal() into a single function. All functionality is still available, but is accessed via the "opt" parameter in the function. opt = 1 replaces RecalX(), opt = 2 replaces Recal_2X(), opt = 3 replaces Recal(), and opt = 4 replaces Recal_2().
- Additional controls were added to IsoFiltR() so now the user can set the matching error allowance for mono/iso pairs using the "Carberr" or "Sulferr" parameters. The maximum allowed 34S ratio can also be set by the user now using the "Sulfrat" parameter.
- Internal change to MFAssign() and MFAssignCHO() now check the O/C and H/C ratios during formula extension, if they exceed the limits set by the user, the formula is discarded. This was done post formula extension in previous versions. 

01/27/2020 (Version 1.0.0)
Please see the ReadMe for more information about changes to the code.
- Improvements to formula extension methodology for improved formula assignment
- Reworked and simplified recalibration in the Recal() function
- Increased user control of "slice" in KMDNoise()
- Improved isotope identification and assignment through changes in IsoFilter() and MFAssign()/MFAssignCHO()
- Made the N3OS to 13C correction in MFAssign() optional

08/14/2020 (Version 1.0.1)
- "Under the hood" changes to allow the package to work with the changes made in R version 4.0.0 and greater.
- Previous version has been archived to create a record of the version of code described in the publication: 
  Schum SK, LE Brown, LR Mazzoleni, MFAssignR: Molecular Formula Assignment Software for Ultrahigh Resolution Mass Spectrometry 
  Analysis of Environmental Complex Mixtures, in press, Environmental Research, 2020.
- New elements have been added for assignment, including 79Br, 81Br, and 126I.
- All functions have been adjusted so that they can handle a two or three column data frame, allowing the user to assign molecular formulas to LC-MS data while retaining the retention time.
- Made improvements to Recal() which allows it to avoid the problems associated with having "holes" in the calibration mass list, which caused errors previously.
- Made improvements to FindCoreFormula() which improve the assignment coverage from the initial CHOFIT assignment, which improves the assignment of isolated peaks.
- Made general improvements to IsoFiltR to ensure all appropriate peaks are retained.
